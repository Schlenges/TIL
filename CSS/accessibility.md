- HTML offers the **accesskey** attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or bring focus to an element. This can make navigation more efficient for keyboard-only users. HTML5 allows this attribute to be used on any element, but it's particularly useful when it's used with interactive ones. This includes links, buttons, and form controls.
